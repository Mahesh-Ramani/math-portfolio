Check out carmichael.pdf on information about carmichael.py. 

carmichael.py produces carmichael numbers up to a specified limit, N.

In carmichael.py, I implement a constructive search for Carmichael numbers up to N using Korseltâ€™s theorem and CRT-based pruning to generate candidate prime tuples efficiently. carmichael.pdf provides more information on the mechanism behind how this works.
