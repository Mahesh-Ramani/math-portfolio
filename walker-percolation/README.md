Will update this README when I write the corresponding paper

We analyze percolation limits of walker constellations and compare them to stochastic arrangements. the code dives deeper into the "masking effect" of walker constellations specifically, where signs of satellite removal are delayed to the extent where the removal of a few satellites results in a massive drop in GCC size.

in "result graphs" folder, graph results are shown by varying parameters from a default arrangement. The default setting is the SIM_CONFIG dictionary in constellation-resilience-simulator.py
